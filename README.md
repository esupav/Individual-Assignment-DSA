**Course**:Data structure and algorithm

## Algorithm
Input: An array arr of size n. Handle edge case: If the array is empty, return or print an error message. Initialize a variable min to the first element of the array: min = arr[0]. Traverse the array starting from the second element: -For each element arr[i], compare it with min. -If arr[i] < min, update min to arr[i]. After the loop finishes, min contains the smallest number in the array. Output: Return or print min. How to Run the Code Clone the repository to your local machine. Open the terminal and navigate to the repository directory. Compile the C++ code using: Run the compiled program: ./main

how to run the code the problem will output:the smallest number in the array.
